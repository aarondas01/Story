London’s Horniman Museum announced that it will return 72 artifacts to Nigeria that British troops looted in the 19th century. 

According to Josh Halliday of the Guardian, the announcement marks the first time that a government-funded institution in Britain has agreed to relinquish treasures that were looted in 1897—despite years-long debate over these artifacts’ ownership.
